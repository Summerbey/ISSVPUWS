                      <h1>Representation to raise up your voices.</h1>
                      <h2>Representation!</h2>
                      <p>Make a change and have your voice heard at UWS by becoming a student rep, sharing your policy ideas, or simply letting us know how your university experience is going.</p>
                      <p>Just like a workers Union – the Students’ Union exists to represent the interests of students at UWS and works independently from UWS!</p>
                      <p>The Union is led by four full time Student Presidents, elected by students for students. They work with elected teams of School Officers, Divisional Reps, and Course Reps who all work together to make UWS even better for students.</p>
                      <p>Student Representation covers all of the ways in which students have a voice in the way UWS is run. It includes the work of course and divisional representatives, as well as the work of School Officers and Student Presidents. But representation isn't just for elected representatives - your voice is also heard through surveys, questionnaires, focus groups, and talking to your reps.</p>
                      <h1>Find Your Reps</h1>
                      <p>Find your reps at UWS - from course reps all the way up to the student president!</p>
                      <p>There are four different types of rep at UWS so whatever you want to talk to them about, find out more about them below. If you want to find out more about how student representation at UWS works read all about it.</p>
